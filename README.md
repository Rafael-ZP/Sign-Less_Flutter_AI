Project SignLess 🗣️➡️🤖
A Flutter-based assistive app for speech-impaired individuals. The app listens to external speech, processes it using Gemini LLM, and provides AI-generated responses based on sentiment (Positive, Negative, or Neutral). Users can select from multiple AI-suggested responses, which the app then speaks out loud.
